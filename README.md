## About The Project

I started Black Bolt around January this 2021 to serve as a server bot but he has grown alot since then. Black Bolt started off with only 200 lines of code and he now has
over 3000. He was only for our server in the beginning but now shares with 13 other partner and user servers. Black Bolt continues to grow every update.
